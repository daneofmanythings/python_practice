# Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them,
# find the numbers that are overlapping.
# One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000,
# and the other .txt file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.

# (If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be 
# divided by any other number. And yes, happy numbers are a 
# real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia.
# The explanation is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)
